My submissions for the #thirtydaysofcode challenge include READMEs that are actually small blog posts. It makes sense to turn these submissions into something I can put on my personal website and Gatsby seems to be a great tool to accomplish that.</p>\n<p>Today I will setup a small static blog website using Gatsby and the READMEs included in every day's submission (including this one!).</p>\n<h2>Result</h2>\n<p>Today's result is a fully working, very basic blog showing all articles / READMEs written as submissions in my #thirtydaychallenge. I use Gatsby's file loader to gain access to all files in the <code>submissions</code> folder and filter out everything but the README.md files in the top-level directories of the submissions. I then parse these into blog posts using Gatsby's createPage API. The page is wrapped in a Layout using Material UI, which I hadn't tried before.</p>\n<p>The main page for the blog shows all blog posts with excerpts, sorted by the date provided at the top of the Markdown files. I also provide a link to the GitHub folder in every post by taking the absolute base path, removing everything non-related to the repository and replacing it with the GitHub repository URL.</p>\n<p>The resulting blog will be updated over time and expanded with new features (and obviously new articles).</p>","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/ericpolman/git/pp/thirty-days-of-code/submissions/day-006-gatsby/README.md","frontmatter":{"date":"May 03, 2020","path":"/blog/day-6-gatsby-static-site-generation","title":"Day 6: Gatsby - Static Site Generation"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
